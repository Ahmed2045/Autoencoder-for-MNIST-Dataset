# Autoencoder-for-MNIST-Dataset
##overview
This repository contains a simple autoencoder implementation using the Keras library for the MNIST dataset. The autoencoder is designed to compress and reconstruct images through an encoding and decoding process.
The project implements a convolutional autoencoder using the Keras library. The autoencoder consists of an encoder and a decoder. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset to compress and reconstruct images.
